# Extended-Profile
Longer description what I'm looking for and my background.
I am looking for entry level experience in flutter/dart development. I’m willing to trade work (analysis, documentation, coding, etc,) for the chance to work on real projects, and perhaps for production-level mentoring. At this time (6/9/21) I’d be happy to discuss any type of ‘real’ project (mobile, desktop, web) for NGO, start-up, commercial.

In leaving the academic environment (early 2020) I wanted more OOP programming experience. After working with Java for several months, I shifted to Kotlin (a ‘better’ language IMHO). In fall of 2020 I moved to the Flutter/Dart environment because it has the strong OOP basis, and in addition:
- has strong Google support,
- is designed for and moving well into wide cross-platform usage,
- has a strong active working and support community,
- has high potential to be a major future framework/language. 
I’ve found the declarative language structure more of a challenge than the class/OOP concepts, but it gets clearer with experience.

Around the first of this year (2021) I felt the need to move beyond “watch/copy” videos and began looking for deeper tutorials. After completing Angela Yu’s Flutter/Dart Bootcamp on Udemy, I started working with the numerous tutorials by Reso Coder (an excellent teacher!). I’ve worked on navigation,  state management (native, provider, riverpod, bloc … still working!), and with Firebase (auth, cloud storage, DB, storage). I’m now on Reso Coder’s “Flutter Firebase & DDD Course”; the very structured approach is good for deeper learning.

Background
I’ve written a lot of computer code over the years, mostly in support of my electrical engineering practice. Much of it was assembler for numerous chips, starting with the Intel 4004 then on to MOS Tech 6502, RCA 1802, Motorola 68000 series, and later Intel chips.

My degrees are in Electrical Engineering, so my background in coding and programming languages is ‘spotty.’ Over the years I’ve worked with numerous languages (Ada, COBOL, APL, DBase, SQL, C/C++, etc) but not at a production level. I watched the structured programming/strong typing/OOP languages grow but didn’t have the need to do the hard work to learn underlying concepts.

I started my career in hardware (digital design) with NASA, then progressed through software engineering, system engineering, and finally project management. In returning to ‘real engineering’ (last 15+ years), I’ve produced a number of (hardware/software) systems for medical and other academic research labs. Over the years I’ve worked professionally with several higher-level languages: Fortran, Basic, Pascal, and LabVIEW.
